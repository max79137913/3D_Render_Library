Visual Studio Version: Microsoft Visual C++ 2010

Please open the VS solution to see my work. 

Using my built-up GzFramework.

Just adding 6 renders and displays and apply the filter to all of them. Finally, combine them into one image.

In procedure texture algorithm, I use Perline Noise Algorithm and set up a 64*64 texture map.

You can choose the interpStyle by GZ_COLOR or GZ_INTERPOLATE and choose tex_fun or ptex_fun as the texture function.

And there are some holes while rendering, which is the result of bug in HW2. 

Thanks for reading.
